## 🩺 DocuMeds: A Patient Record Site

DocuMeds is a web application built using **Python Flask** that allows doctors to manage patient medical records efficiently.  
It collects key information like **name, age, sex, history, investigations, and medicines given
so that during future visits, doctors can quickly review the past treatment and make informed decisions. 
This helps save time and improves the quality of patient care.
